                                                Project-HELPCARE
 Our Helpcare system is a framework of Organization which help people to look for a community doctor or a therapist to book an appointment. Community people can also be able to look for the event happening in the community and book appointments. People can opt for Emergency service and expect the ambulance early at the scene. Patient should be able to look for the Insurance plans and the customer providers list.

Listed down the Enterprise roles and responsibilities

Hospital:

Even the most efficient Doctors and mental health practitioners could use some help with scheduling appointments for their patients. Here are just some of the most common issues 
•	Allow mental health patients to book appointments outside of clinic hours
•	Offer mental health patients, their preferred therapy time slots based on your live availability
•	Send out automated booking confirmations and reminders to reduce cancellations and no-shows

Insurance:
Health insurance covers the costs of a variety of services that promote sound physical and mental health, including physical examinations, diagnostic testing, surgery, dental treatments, and corrective prescription lenses for vision deficiencies. 

Emergency:

In an emergency, you should access the closest hospital that can help you with the scene by accessing the location from the contact of SoS. That hospital will treat you regardless of whether you have insurance. Your insurance company can't charge you more for getting emergency room services at an out-of-network hospital.

Community:

Community admin can be able to create houses and host the Helpcare event inside the community requested by the patient.
